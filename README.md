## Summary
Fisher's Iris data set records petal and sepal lenghts and widths in centimetres from 3 related Iris flower species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). It was first published in 1936 by the biologist and statistician Ronald Fischer, as part of his paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. The data set contains a total of 150 samples, 50 of each flower species. Based on a linear combination of the 4 measured features (lenghts and widths of petals and sepals), Fischer developed a statistical method to distinguish between the 3 species of Iris. The data set is still widely used as a test case for machine learning techniques. 


## Task
Write a program (**analysis.py**) that reads Fisher's Iris data set, outputs the summary of each variable to a txt file, saves a histogram of each variable as png images, and outputs a scatter plot of each pair  of variables.
